# HFSE Markbook — Claude Instructions

A web app replacing manual Google Sheets grading at HFSE International School, Singapore. This file is the contract for everything that ships. Read it first.

## Always Do First

- **Invoke the 'ui-ux-pro-max@ui-ux-pro-max-skill' skill** before writing frontend code, every session, no exceptions.

## Hard rules — never violate

These are non-negotiable. Code that breaks any of them does not ship.

### 1. Formula must return 93 on the canonical test case

Input: `WW=[10,10]/max=[10,10]`, `PT=[6,10,10]/max=[10,10,10]`, `QA=22/30`, weights `40/40/20`. Expected `quarterly_grade=93`. Verified by `lib/compute/quarterly.ts` self-test on module load — if it throws at build time, stop and fix before anything else.

### 2. All grade computation is server-side

Clients send raw scores and receive computed PS / Initial / Quarterly. Never compute in the browser. Single source of truth: `lib/compute/quarterly.ts`.

### 3. Blank ≠ Zero

`null` = "did not take the assessment", excluded from both numerator and denominator. `0` = "took it, scored zero", included in both. `ScoreInput` preserves this through string-level local state — empty string → `null`, `"0"` → `0`.

### 4. `studentNumber` is the only stable student ID

Never use `enroleeNumber` — it resets each AY. Cross-year linking always goes through `studentNumber` from the admissions tables.

### 5. Post-lock edits require `approval_reference`

Any PATCH to a locked sheet must include a non-empty `approval_reference` in the body. Server returns 400 if missing. Each changed field appends one row to `grade_audit_log`.

### 6. Grade entries and audit logs are append-only

Removing a score sets it to `null` with an audit entry. Withdrawn students stay in `section_students` with `enrollment_status='withdrawn'`. Audit log is never updated or deleted; unlocking does not purge it.

### 7. Design system is binding; `app/app/globals.css` is the only source for tokens

All UI must conform to `docs/context/09-design-system.md`. Colors, fonts, radius, and shadows are defined exactly once in `app/app/globals.css` and consumed through shadcn semantic Tailwind classes (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `bg-card`, `bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`, `ring-ring`, `bg-chart-1…5`, `bg-sidebar*`, etc.). **Never** hardcode `#rrggbb`, `oklch(...)`, or use `slate-*` / `zinc-*` / `gray-*` Tailwind utilities in `app/` or `components/`. **Never** redefine tokens in component code or in a `tailwind.config.*` file — Tailwind v4 has no JS config in this project. To change a color, edit `globals.css`.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack, TypeScript) — single deployable at `/app`
- **Supabase** (Postgres + Auth, `@supabase/ssr`) — single shared project also hosting admissions tables
- **Tailwind CSS v4** via `@tailwindcss/postcss` (no `tailwind.config.js`)
- **Vercel** — deployment target
- **PDF generation deferred** — browser Print / Save as PDF covers current volume. If automation is needed later, prefer Puppeteer-in-Next.js over the original Python/WeasyPrint plan.

### Next.js 16 gotchas

These differ from Next 15 and from typical training data. Authoritative reference: `app/node_modules/next/dist/docs/`.

- **`middleware.ts` is renamed to `proxy.ts`**. The exported function must be named `proxy`. See `app/proxy.ts`.
- `cookies()`, `headers()`, `params`, `searchParams` are async — always `await`.
- Use `@supabase/ssr`, never the deprecated `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`.
- Use `next/navigation` for redirects in server components, never `next/router`.

## Project layout

Single deployable: `/app` (Next.js → Vercel). No `/pdf-service` (deferred).

## Environment variables

```bash
# app/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=        # server-only, bypasses RLS
PDF_SERVICE_URL=             # reserved, currently unused
```

Original plan had separate `ADMISSIONS_SUPABASE_*` vars; dropped because admissions and grading share one Supabase project. `lib/supabase/admissions.ts` reuses `createServiceClient()`.

## Key decisions

1. **Single Supabase project** for grading + admissions tables.
2. **Roles in `app_metadata.role`** (`teacher | registrar | admin | superadmin`). No `user_roles` table.
3. **Teacher assignments** in `teacher_assignments` table: `(user × section × subject × role)` where role is `form_adviser` (one per section) or `subject_teacher` (one per section × subject). Gates `/api/grading-sheets` list and `PUT /api/sections/[id]/comments`.
4. **Weights per `(subject × level × AY)`** in `subject_configs`. Primary 40/40/20, Secondary 30/50/20. Never hardcoded.
5. **Max 5 WW + 5 PT slots per sheet** (`subject_configs.ww_max_slots / pt_max_slots`).
6. **Max 50 students per section.**
7. **Overall annual grade** = `T1×0.20 + T2×0.20 + T3×0.20 + T4×0.40`, rounded 2dp. See `lib/compute/annual.ts`.
8. **PDF generation deferred** — browser print covers current volume.
9. **RLS is permissive** (`USING (true)` for authenticated reads) on all tables. Tighten before production UAT — backlog item.

## Workflow

1. Read `docs/sprints/development-plan.md` for current sprint + status snapshot.
2. Build against the sprint's Definition of Done. Don't ship anything that breaks a hard rule above.
3. Verify with `npx next build` (clean compile required) and a manual happy-path test in the browser before marking anything done.
4. After meaningful work, run **`/sync-docs`** to keep this file and the dev plan accurate. The slash command surveys the repo, diffs against both docs, and applies targeted edits.
